# Reverse Proxy capabilities with CIS

In this section we will be exploring two modes that CIS can be configured for in order to publish Kubernetes HTTP services; Ingress and VirtualServer CRD.

## Ingress Examples

In this section we provide examples for the most common use-cases of Ingress Resources with F5 CIS

- [Basic-Ingress](cis-ingress/basic-ingress)
- [FQDN-Based-Routing](cis-ingress/host-routing)
- [Fan-out/Path-Based-Routing](cis-ingress/fanout)
- [Health Monitor](cis-ingress/health-monitor)
- [AppRoot/URL Rewrite](cis-ingress/rewrite)
- [TLS Ingress Examples](cis-ingress/tls)

## VirtualServer CRD Examples

- [Basic-VS](cis-crd/VirtualServer/Basic/)
- [CustomPort-VS](cis-crd/VirtualServer/CustomPort/)
- [Path Rewrite](cis-crd/VirtualServer/PathRewrite/#path-rewrite-rewrite)
